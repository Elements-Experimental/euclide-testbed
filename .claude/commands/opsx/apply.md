Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name (e.g., `/opsx:apply add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx:apply <other>`).

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - Context file paths (varies by schema)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using `/opsx:continue`
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, proceed to write protocol.md (see step 7)
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

4. **Read context files**

   Read the files listed in `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

5. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

6. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Mark task complete in the tasks file: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

7. **On all tasks complete: write protocol.md**

   When all tasks are done, write the test protocol at `openspec/changes/<name>/protocol.md`.

   Use the template at `openspec/schemas/elements-impact/templates/protocol.md` and the spec scenarios from `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/*/spec.md` as input.

   For each spec scenario, create a corresponding protocol step with a concrete action and expected result. Mark each step that requires human observation with `<!-- HUMAN CHECKPOINT -->`. Use `- [ ]` checkboxes (do NOT pre-check them).

   Commit:
   ```bash
   git add openspec/changes/<name>/protocol.md
   git commit -m "chore(<name>): add test protocol"
   ```

8. **Open a draft PR**

   After committing protocol.md:
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --head <current-branch> \
     --base feat/<slug> \
     --title "feat: <slug>" \
     --draft \
     --body "Implementation of change <slug>. See openspec/changes/<slug>/tasks.md for task breakdown."
   ```

   Report the PR URL.

9. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: "Protocol written, draft PR opened. The developer will run `/opsx:walk` to verify, then `/opsx:ship` to finalize."
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Output On Completion**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 7/7 tasks complete ✓

### Completed This Session
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
...

✓ protocol.md written
✓ Draft PR opened: <PR-URL>

The developer will run `/opsx:walk <change-name>` to verify, then `/opsx:ship <change-name>` to finalize.
```

**Output On Pause (Issue Encountered)**

```
## Implementation Paused

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 4/7 tasks complete

### Issue Encountered
<description of the issue>

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names
- **Do not run `/opsx:archive`** — archiving is done by the developer via `/opsx:ship` after human verification
- Do not pre-check `- [ ]` items in protocol.md — the developer runs the protocol, not the agent

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly
